# Emoji Context Project
## Description
Emojis have become ubiquitous in textual communication on the web. Each emoji has a 'face' meaning - (i.e. the underlying emotion or activity being conveyed by
the image) and a contextual meaning (one that has evolved from usage and based on context). Sometimes the contextual meaning or connotation of the emoji is totally
different than the face meaning. For example, the smiling emoji is often used to express sarcasm or frustration to convey holding back emotion behind the smile
rather than the face meaning of a pleasant expression.

Most of what we understand about word/emoji connotation comes from using language and being a part of the communication. This project seeks to analyze and 
concretely describe the underlying meanings that English speakers have assigned to these images. 

For this project, I want to scrape English language Tweets that contain emojis, rank the most commonly used emojis, and 
aggregate the words most commonly associated with that emoji using Python libraries.
